    <h1>The Calling</h1>

    <p>There are some who feel it in their bones—the quiet ache that something is not as it seems. A memory of a vow made long ago. A promise buried beneath responsibility, distraction, and pain. But it was never lost.</p>

    <p>This page is for those who hear the signal. Who feel the pull toward something sacred, ancient, and alive. You are not here by accident. You have wandered far, yes—but not aimlessly. The time has come to remember why you came.</p>

    <p>The Father Who Dared a Child to Dream is not one man—it is an archetype. A frequency. A presence that speaks not just of strength, but of sacrifice. Not domination, but devotion. Not control, but covenant.</p>

    <p>We are calling the fathers, the guardians, the protectors, the poets, the builders, the broken men who still kneel before beauty and whisper prayers no one else hears. If that is you—</p>

    <p>Then answer.</p>
