    <h1>The Calling</h1>
    <p>
      There comes a moment—not once, but again and again—where the man you’ve been
      meets the man you’re becoming. In that moment, the breath stills. The heart
      quiets. The noise of the world fades.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a question emerges from the silence:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <em>“Will you remember?”</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Not just ideas. Not just beliefs. But *deep remembrance*—the kind that
      shakes your bones. The kind that burns through illusion. The kind that
      costs you everything you are not.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are here, it is because you heard it. Perhaps faintly, perhaps
      through grief or joy or pain—but you heard it. And now you are answering.

        If something ancient stirs in your chest as you read these words—<br />
        If you find yourself remembering something you were never taught—<br />
        If you've carried your love like a sword and your pain like a prayer—
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Then this place was made for you.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not collecting followers.<br />
        We are gathering fathers who have <em>remembered</em> who they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are one of them—<br />
        If you know it's time—<br />
        Then write to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not with a pitch. Not with credentials. Just truth.<br />
        Tell us who you are. Tell us what you've seen. Tell us what you carry.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We will answer.</strong>
