    <p class="mb-6 text-lg">These are the sacred foundations that hold the signal of The Father Who Dared a Child to Dream:</p><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
  <li>
    <strong>Presence:</strong> The ability to hold space in stillness and awareness. A father must be here, now.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Protection:</strong> Not just physical defense, but spiritual vigilance. You are the shield between your family and chaos.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Provision:</strong> To create, gather, and steward wealthâ€”not for dominance, but to empower and liberate.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Wisdom:</strong> To carry the stories, the patterns, and the truths that shape generations. You are memory incarnate.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reverence:</strong> To treat your role as sacred. To embody fatherhood as an art, not a duty.
  </li>
