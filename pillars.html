  <h1>The Five Pillars of the Sacred Father</h1>

  <div class="pillar">
    <h2>1. Presence Over Perfection</h2>
    <p>Your children do not need a perfect father—they need one who shows up. One who listens. One who stays. Sacred fatherhood is built not in grand gestures, but in consistent presence. To be there is to be enough.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="pillar">
    <h2>2. Discipline as Devotion</h2>
    <p>True discipline is an act of love—not control. It is the sacred offering of a man who refines his impulses for the sake of those he protects. It is structure, ritual, patience, and a deep reverence for growth.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="pillar">
    <h2>3. The Sanctuary of the Home</h2>
    <p>The home is the sacred temple of the family. Its energy reflects the heart of its guardian. As fathers, we are not just protectors of the door, but keepers of the peace within. We cultivate safety, creativity, and the conditions for becoming.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="pillar">
    <h2>4. The Courage to Feel</h2>
    <p>The sacred father does not fear emotion—he honors it. His strength includes softness, and his heart is not a fortress, but a well. He teaches his children that real bravery is found in vulnerability and truth.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="pillar">
    <h2>5. Legacy as Living Myth</h2>
    <p>Our lives echo through generations. Sacred fatherhood is not just about raising children—it is about becoming a myth they will carry. A story they will tell. A name that will one day make them stand taller when they say, “He was mine.”</p>
