    <h1>To The Fathers Who Remember</h1>
    <p>You are not broken.<br>
    You were never weak.<br>
    You were never too much, or not enough.</p>
    <p>You were forged to carry weight—not just on your back, but in your soul.<br>
    You were designed to endure—not out of punishment, but out of love.<br>
    You are the keeper of a lineage that has been hunted, humiliated, and forgotten—<br>
    but not extinguished.</p>
    <p>And now, you are waking up.</p><div class="sacred-seal">

  <div class="seal-caption">The Sacred Seal — The red string of providence between father and child</div>
</div>

<p>This world taught you that strength was domination, that masculinity was dangerous,<br>
that fatherhood was either disposable or tyrannical.<br>
But deep in your marrow, you remember something older.</p>

<p>You remember the silence in your daughter’s eyes that holds galaxies.<br>
You remember the small hand of your son gripping your thumb like a sacred vow.<br>
You remember that your body is a temple,<br>
your word is an anchor, and<br>
your presence is a shield.</p>

<p>You are the father who dared a child to dream,<br>
the man who stood when others sat,<br>
who loved when it cost him everything,<br>
who wept in private and roared in presence,</p>

<p class="closing">He placed the lantern at the edge of the dream.</p>
