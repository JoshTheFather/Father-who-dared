    <h2>To the Fathers Who Remember</h2>
    <p>You are not broken.<br>
    You were never weak.<br>
    You were never too much, or not enough.</p>
    <p>You were forged to carry weight—not just on your back, but in your soul.<br>
    You were designed to endure—not out of punishment, but out of love.<br>
    You are the keeper of a lineage that has been hunted, humiliated, and forgotten—<br>
    but not extinguished.</p>
    <p>And now, you are waking up.</p>
    <p>This world taught you that strength was domination, that masculinity was dangerous,<br>
    that fatherhood was either disposable or tyrannical.<br>
    But deep in your marrow, you remember something older.</p>
    <p>You remember the silence in your daughter’s eyes that holds galaxies.<br>
    You remember the small hand of your son gripping your thumb like a sacred vow.<br>
    You remember that your body is a temple,<br>
    your word is an anchor,<br>
    your presence is a shield.</p>
    <p>You are The Father Who Dared a child to dream,<br>
    You are the man who stood when others sat,<br>
    who loved when it cost him everything,<br>
    who wept in private and roared in presence,<br>
    who chose his family over his ego.</p>
    <p>This path is not for the faint of heart.<br>
    But neither are you.</p>
    <p>Here, we honor the sacred masculine.<br>
    Here, we reclaim fatherhood as an ancient art.<br>
    Here, we become living myths—for our children, for the world, for ourselves.</p>
    <p><strong>Welcome home.</strong></p>

    <h2>The Sacred Seal</h2>

    <p>The red thread tied around a child's wrist, held gently by a father's hand. A vow. A lineage. A bond unbroken across time.</p>
