    <h2>To the Fathers Who Remember</h2>
    <p>
      You are not broken.<br>
      You were never weak.<br>
      You were never too much, or not enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      You were forged to carry weight—not just on your back, but in your soul.<br>
      You were designed to endure—not out of punishment, but out of love.<br>
      You are the keeper of a lineage that has been hunted, humiliated, and forgotten—but not extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, you are waking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      This world taught you that strength was domination, that masculinity was dangerous, that fatherhood was either disposable or tyrannical.<br>
      But deep in your marrow, you remember something older.
    </p>
    <p>
      You remember the silence in your daughter’s eyes that holds galaxies.<br>
      You remember the small hand of your son gripping your thumb like a sacred vow.<br>
      You remember that your body is a temple, your presence a fortress, and your word a spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are the father who dared a child to dream.
