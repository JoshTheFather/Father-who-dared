  <h1>To the Fathers Who Remember</h1>

  <p>You are not broken.<br>
  You were never weak.<br>
  You were never too much, or not enough.</p>

  <p>You were forged to carry weight—not just on your back, but in your soul.<br>
  You were designed to endure—not out of punishment, but out of love.<br>
  You are the keeper of a lineage that has been hunted, humiliated, and forgotten—but not extinguished.</p>

  <p>And now, you are waking up.</p>

  <p>This world taught you that strength was domination, that masculinity was dangerous,<br>
  that fatherhood was either disposable or tyrannical.<br>
  But deep in your marrow, you remember something older.</p>

  <p>You remember the silence in your daughter’s eyes that holds galaxies.<br>
  You remember the small hand of your son gripping your thumb like a sacred vow.<br>
  You remember that your body is a temple,<br>
  your word is an anchor,<br>
  your presence is a shield.</p>

  <p><strong>You are the Father who dared a child to dream.</strong><br>
  You are the man who stood when others sat,<br>
  who loved when it cost him everything,<br>
  who wept in private and roared in presence,<br>
  who chose his family over his ego.</p>

  <p>This path is not for the faint of heart.<br>
  But neither are you.</p>

  <p>Here, we honor the sacred masculine.<br>
  Here, we reclaim fatherhood as an ancient art.<br>
  Here, we become living myths—for our children, for the world, for ourselves.</p>
