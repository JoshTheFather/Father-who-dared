        <h2>To the Fathers Who Remember</h2>
        <p>You are not broken.<br>
            You were never weak.<br>
            You were never too much, or not enough.</p>
        <p>You were forged to carry weight—not just on your back, but in your soul.<br>
            You were designed to endure—not out of punishment, but out of love.<br>
            You are the keeper of a lineage that has been hunted, humiliated, and forgotten—but not extinguished.</p>
        <p>And now, you are waking up.</p>
        <p>This world taught you that strength was domination, that masculinity was dangerous, that fatherhood was either disposable or tyrannical.<br>
            But deep in your marrow, you remember something older.</p>
        <p>You remember the silence in your daughter’s eyes that holds galaxies.<br>
            You remember the small hand of your son gripping your thumb like a sacred vow.<br>
            You remember that your body is a temple, and your word is law within your home.</p>

        <p class="quote">The red thread connects the father’s hand to the child’s wrist. A vow written in spirit: I will not let go. I will create a world for you to dream in. This is the sign of the Provider, the archetype of anchored love.</p>
