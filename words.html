  <h2>Entry One</h2>
  <h3>We Chose Each Other First</h3>

  <p>We met each other with no expectations. After standing each other up twice, we finally met on the third try.</p>

  <p>Our first date was at the cinema, and something clicked—fast, deep, and real. We spent every day we could together after that.</p>

  <p>We came to each other as broken people. I had left a relationship where nothing I gave was ever enough, and she came from a family that resented the very light that made her beautiful.</p>

  <p>But the moment I felt her warmth, something began to heal. She smiled at me like I was everything—from the very first day. She laughed when I admitted I’d worried she was a catfish. I was just relieved she was real—and even more beautiful than I’d hoped.</p>

  <p>We laughed in a pub on a cow-shaped seat. She smoked roll-ups instead of cigarettes. She worried I’d judge her little flat—but I didn’t care. She was nervous to visit mine—she’d never done anything like that before. She was excited just to have a bath. And I understood something essential about her from the start: <strong>she just wants to be warm.</strong></p>

  <p>So I made sure she was. I bought her warm clothes, heat pads, thick socks. She became part of my family the moment she arrived. She got a cuddle from my dad the first time he met her. She was so happy just to belong.</p>

  <p>It hasn’t been easy. My ex—struggling with borderline personality disorder—tried to destroy us. She called social services. My kids were taken—but returned once the truth was known. It was terrifying to open my home again, but I knew it was right with her.</p>

  <p>During COVID, we couldn’t see each other. I had vowed: no more relationships, no more children. I was battling a cocaine addiction brought on by the pain of my past. She never judged. She loved me through it. And because of her, <strong>I got clean.</strong></p>

  <p>We chose each other. Over and over again.</p>

  <p>She became stepmum to my sons. They adore her. She gave everything for them.</p>

  <p>We got engaged. We married. She walked toward me with bright red hair like a flame.</p>

  <p>Then—twins. We lost them at 24 weeks. The pain should have broken us. Instead, it bound us tighter. We never left each other.</p>

  <p>After almost two years of trying again, we were blessed with our daughter. We wept when we found out it was a girl.</p>

  <p>The pregnancy was hard. But she arrived—perfect. And she brought <strong>light</strong> into our home like nothing before. The boys adore her. Especially my eldest.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>The secret is this:</strong> Hold love higher than everything. Do whatever you can to make life better for your partner.</p>

  <p>The sacred moments aren’t in luxury or perfection. They’re in bedtime stories. Cheap, last-minute dates. Snacks in bed. Cuddles until sleep.</p>

  <p>She supported me through everything—especially my powerlifting. She believes in me. I can’t say no to her. I do everything for her.</p>

  <p>Because she does everything for me.</p>

  <p>We are grateful—<strong>every day.</strong></p>

  <p>If you're reading this wondering if love like this still exists—</p>

  <p><strong>It does. We are proof. Just choose each other. And never stop.</strong></p>
